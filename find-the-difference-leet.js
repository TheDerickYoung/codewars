//You are given two strings s and t.

//String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

//Return the letter that was added to t.

 

//Example 1:

//Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
//Output: "e"
//Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
//Example 2:

//Input: s = "", t = "y"
//Output: "y"
 

//Constraints:

//0 <= s.length <= 1000
//t.length == s.length + 1
//s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
